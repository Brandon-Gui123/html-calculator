# Handheld Calculator Web Application

## Goals

Build a simple, functioning calculator that is accessible
from any browser and behaves like a handheld, standard calculator.

### Features

#### Keypad for 0-9

We'll introduce the keypad to type in digits ranging from
0 to 9.

#### Clear Button

Just like the traditional calculators, this comes with an AC button to clear the display and go back to 0.

#### Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide

4 basic operations. To apply one of these operators, enter a number, press any one of these, then enter another number. Afterwards, press the equal button to evaluate and get the result.

##### Repeat Operation

Some calculators allow you to repeat specific operations on them.

For example, after adding 2 numbers and pressing the equal button, you can press the equal button again and then 2nd number you entered earlier will be added to the result.

#### Decimal Button

Pressing the decimal button will place a period where the digit is.

For example, if the display shows 1234, then pressing the decimal button places the decimal after 4. So numbers after 4 belong to the decimal place.
